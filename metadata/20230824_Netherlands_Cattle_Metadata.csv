1. GENERAL INFORMATION

This table provides information about the number of cattle on Dutch agricultural holdings. In addition to numbers, cattle are broken down by: cattle kept for the production of milk and cattle for fattening. The cattle population is counted on 1 April and 1 December.

Data available from: 1 December 2008 to 1 December 2020.

Status of the figures:
The numbers are final.

Changes as of April 30, 2021:

This table is followed by Livestock on agricultural holdings: reference date 1 April and 1 December, see the links in section 3.

2. DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATION OF SYMBOLS

Definitions:
Cattle population: 
For 1 April counts: total of the number of cattle in the Netherlands on agricultural holdings, of 3,000 Euro SO or more. 
For 1 December counts: Up to and including 2017, the total number of animals from the I&R register (Identification an Registration of animals) was used and the distribution over the animal species of the agricultural census (reference date 1 April) was applied to this. From 2018 onwards, the method has been changed and is now fully in line with the methodology and the population of the agricultural census. The change has virtually no effect on the number of animals. 

SO: Standard Output
A standardised measure for the economic size of agricultural holdings, based on the average annual output from crops or animal categories.
An SO standard is determined for each crop and animal category based on average output values over a period of five years. The SO standards are recalculated every three years. The SO for a holding is calculated by summing the total SO for each crop and animal category. The SO is expressed in Euro.

4. SOURCES AND METHODS

The European Union requires member states to determine the cattle population on agricultural holdings twice a year(in April and November/December). 
The 1 April counts are entirely based on information from the annual agricultural census ('Landbouwtelling'). The 1 December counts are based on the ear tag registration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
